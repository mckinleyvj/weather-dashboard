## Week 6 - Weather Dashboard

In this week's assignment, I will be creating a weather dashboard by using Server-side APIs. This one in particular will be based from Openweather.
- It will display a search box based on the 'City' of interest.
- It will display the current and future weather conditions of that particular 'City'.
- Search will be stored as history for future references.
- After searching for a 'City', it will display the weather information for that city/location. It will also display the 5 days forecast.
- After searching a city, it will be stored and will allow user to quickly select that city again for later.
- User can delete a search history.
- Added feature: Allow user to use "Location" feature, which will get the location of the user and displays the weather information in their area.
