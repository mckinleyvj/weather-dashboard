## Week 6 - Weather Dashboard

In this week's assignment, I will be creating a weather dashboard by using Server-side APIs. This one in particular will be based from Openweather.
- It will display a search box based on the 'City' of interest.
- It will display the current and future weather conditions of that particular 'City'.
- Search will be stored as history for future references.
- After searching for a 'City', it will display:
  - Name, Date, Icon representation of weather conditions, Temperature, Humidity, Wind speed, and the UV index.
